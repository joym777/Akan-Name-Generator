# ABOUT PROJECT.
The Akan Name generator  is a aimple web application that tells the user their akan name- their west african traditional name based on the day of the week one is born and their gender. 

- Akan names play a meaningful part in West African culture, with the name and gender corresponding to their specific names. This interractive project shows recognition and appreciation to the West african culture. 

## Key Project Features:
- User inputs and submits their name, date of birth and gender.
- Includes input validation to ensure correct and valid data entry.
- Calculates the day of the week user is born using a formula.
- Displays user's akan name dynamically on the page.

## Formula Used For Calculation âž—
    Thr formula used is a variation of Zeller's congruence, an algorithm used to calculate the day of the week for any given date. 
    The algorithm uses modular arithmetic to find the day of the week based on an altered calendar system thattreats January and February as the 13th and 14th months of the previous year.
#### d=((4CCâˆ’2Ã—CCâˆ’1)+(45Ã—YY)+(1026Ã—(MM+1))+DD) Mod 7
Where: 
 cc= first two digits of the year. (also treated as the century)
 yy= The last two digits of the year.
###### eg. for 1977, cc- 19 yy-77
mm= month.
dd= day.
